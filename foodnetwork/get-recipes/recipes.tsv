We add ice water to the soup just before blending, eliminating chilling time, and broil the quesadillas on a baking sheet so they can be cooked simultaneously. They crisp up in just a couple of minutes!	Easy	15	10	-1	5	4 servings	1/2 cup sour cream__1 English cucumber roughly chopped (about 8 ounces)__1 small clove garlic, grated__1 scallion, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated__1 scallion, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated__Fine salt__1 medium green tomato, roughly chopped (about 8 ounces)__1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling__One 15-ounce can cannellini beans, strained and rinsed__Freshly ground black pepper__Four 8-inch flour tortillas__6 slices smoked gouda cheese (about 6 ounces)__Sliced pickled jalapenos, for serving	Preheat the broiler with a rack set about 4 inches from the heat source.__Put 1/4 cup of the sour cream, 1/4 cup iced water mixed with ice cubes, the sliced cucumbers, garlic, scallion whites and a large pinch salt in a blender. Blend until mostly smooth, then add the tomatoes. Blend until smooth, then remove the small cap on the lid of the blender and slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup of the oil while the blender is running. Season with additional salt if needed. Place the soup in the freezer while you prepare the quesadillas.__Place the cannellini beans and a pinch black pepper in a bowl, and roughly mash with the back of a fork. Place 2 of the tortillas on a baking sheet without letting them overlap. Brush one side of the tortillas with some of the remaining olive oil. Flip, so the oiled side is directly on the baking sheet. Divide the mashed cannellini beans between the two tortillas and use a fork or your fingers to spread the mixture evenly on the tortillas, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Lay 3 pieces of the cheese on top of the beans on each tortilla (it is okay if the cheese overlaps slightly). Top with the remaining 2 tortillas and brush the tops of the tortillas with the remaining oil.__Place the quesadillas under the broiler and cook until the top tortillas are crisp and lightly golden brown, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to flip the quesadillas and cook until the cheese is completely melted and the tortillas are crisp and lightly golden brown, about 1 additional minute. Cut each into 6 wedges.__To serve, ladle (or pour directly from the blender carafe) the soup in to 4 chilled bowls and drizzle with additional olive oil and several grindings of freshly ground black pepper and some of the sliced green scallions. Serve 3 pieces of quesadilla on the side of each bowl of soup along with a dollop of the remaining sour cream and some pickled jalapenos.

Add half the sugar to the pot and bring to a simmer (just below a boil).

Now pour the liaison (egg mixture) into the milk pot, stirring constantly. You are only heating it. Do not boil. Do not cook. The idea of a liaison is to incorporate the eggs and avoid making them into scrambled eggs! You want the mixture to begin to thicken so it will coat the back of a spoon.

Trim any excess from the top crust before using both hands to crimp the edges of the two crust together to seal. With a sharp knife, make several crosshatch slits in the top crust. Brush with the egg wash and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool 20 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream.__Reserved juices can be reduced with heavy cream for a sauce for the pie.

Massaging the marinade into the chicken works its flavors into the meat, cutting down on marinating time. And you can make the sweet-and-savory watermelon salad while the chicken marinates.	Easy	-1	-1	-1	-1	4 servings	5 large garlic cloves, 4 grated, 1 whole__1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates__Zest and juice of 2 lemons__1 tablespoon dried oregano__4 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)__1/2 medium watermelon (about 3 pounds)__1 garden cucumber, peeled (8 ounces)__One 4-ounce block feta__1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives__Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper__1/2 baguette, halved length-wise__1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, torn into large pieces	Prepare a grill for medium heat.__Put the grated garlic into a large resealable bag. Add 1/4 cup oil, the lemon zest and juice, oregano and the chicken. Seal the bag tightly and use your hands to vigorously massage the marinade into the chicken, making sure that the chicken is evenly coated. Marinate for at least 10 minutes at room temperature.__Meanwhile, remove the rind from the watermelon, cut the flesh into 1-inch cubes and put it in a large bowl. (You should have about 6 cups total.) Quarter the cucumber lengthwise and cut it into 1-inch pieces. Place on top of the watermelon in the mixing bowl. Cut the feta into 1/2-inch cubes, put on top of the cucumber and top with the olives. (Do not mix yet.) Set aside.__Remove the chicken from the marinade and place it on a plate. Lightly oil the grill grates. Sprinkle the chicken liberally with salt and pepper and place the pieces skin-side down on the grill, leaving some space between the pieces. Cook until the skin is lightly charred and releases itself from the grill, about 2 minutes. Rotate the chicken about 90 degrees so that the skin won't burn and cook another 2 minutes. Flip and cook 5 minutes longer. Cover the grill and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each thigh registers 165 degrees F, about 5 more minutes. Transfer to a platter and rest for at least 5 minutes.__While the chicken rests, brush the cut sides of the baguette halves with 2 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the bread cut-side down on the grill until lightly charred and warmed through, about 2 minutes. Halve the remaining garlic clove and lightly rub the cut sides of the garlic onto the hot bread. Halve each piece of baguette.__Scatter most of the mint over the watermelon mixture. Add the remaining 1/4 cup oil and a large pinch of salt and pepper and gently stir to combine. Divide the watermelon salad, chicken and bread among 4 large dinner plates. Garnish with the remaining mint.

Arrange the pierogies snugly flat-side down in the skillet (there may be some overlapping). Cook until the bottoms just begin to brown, about 3 minutes. Pour in 1/2 cup of water and simmer until the pierogi dough is tender and the water has completely evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium and continue cooking until the bottoms are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more; watch carefully as they can go from golden to burnt quickly. Remove from the heat.__While the pierogies cook, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, squeeze the sausage out of the casings into the skillet. Cook the sausage, stirring frequently and breaking it up into bite-size pieces, until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and pepper flakes and stir until the garlic begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Stir in the broccoli. Stir in the broth, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits.

(Gather the dough scraps together, pat into a disk, chill and reroll.)__Refrigerate cookies while preheating the oven to 375 degrees F, for at least 30 minutes.__Bake the cookies, until the bottoms are golden, about 10 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.__Combine all the ingredients, except the food coloring, in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix slowly until stiff enough to form peaks. The icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is overbeaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting.__Alternatively, combine ingredients in a large bowl, and beat with hand beaters on low speed until the frosting thickens to stiff peaks.__Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. (Adding too much color reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days.)

Unfold the chicken thighs so they're covered with the marinade, and lay them as flat as possible. Broil until the chicken is cooked through and browned, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating the pan and flipping the tomatoes and chicken halfway through.__Transfer two chicken thighs and a few tomatoes to each plate. Stir the pan juices into the dilled couscous. Place 1 1/4 cups of couscous on each plate, and top with a scoop of chopped cucumbers, a dollop of yogurt and a lemon wedge.

Smooth over the top of the cake batter in the pan. Bake until the cheesecake is set in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. Cover with foil during last 10 minutes to prevent over browning. Remove from the oven and cool.__A cheesecake is not like a regular cake. It is considered set when the center is still wobbly. After you chill the cheesecake, it will set without wobbling.

Spread the mixture over the baked cheesecake layer and chill well (freezing the cake at this point works well and makes spreading the final layer easier). Make sure you chill for several hours to make sure all the layers are set.__For the dark chocolate/white chocolate ganache: Place the chopped dark chocolate in a large bowl. Heat the cream and butter over low heat until just boiling. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the cream mixture.

Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning.__For the dough: In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt. Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long 'noodle', 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter.__Making the dumplings: Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half-moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up.__Cooking the dumplings: In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp up again.

The yogurt in the dough helps make it tender and pliable so it's easy to roll and shape and won't fall apart on the grill. As a bonus, you can use any plain Greek yogurt you have on hand—from full-fat to non-fat (though full-fat yogurt will yield a slightly more tender crust).

(The dough may appear dry and crumbly at first, but it will come together as you mix it.) Work the dough in the bowl with your hands into a cohesive ball, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of water if it is too crumbly to come together. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until the dough is smooth and slightly elastic, 7 to 8 minutes, dusting with a little more flour as necessary.__Divide the dough in half. Roll each ball on a piece of parchment into a 10- to 11-inch round. Brush the tops of the rounds with olive oil. Slide your hand under each parchment sheet, then invert the dough round onto the grill, peeling away (but not discarding) the parchment. Cover grill and cook until the crust is browned and well marked on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip each round back onto the parchment piece, grilled-side up.__Top crusts with sauce, mozzarella and desired toppings, leaving a half-inch border around the edge. Slide the pizzas off the parchment and back onto the grill. Cover and grill until the underside is browned and well-marked and the cheese is bubbly, 4 to 5 minutes.

Add the mushrooms, 1/4 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic, flour and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until the tomato paste darkens a little, about 1 minute. Add the chicken broth, wine, onions, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and more pepper. Bring to a boil, then let simmer until thickened, about 4 minutes.__Turn the heat down to medium, and whisk in the butter a little at a time. If the sauce tastes a little too acidic, add the sugar. Nestle the chicken and cooked bacon into the sauce, and simmer gently until the chicken is heated through, 6 to 7 minutes. (This could take up to 10 minutes if the chicken is cold, or as little as 3 minutes if it is warm.) Spoon the sauce over the chicken pieces periodically to coat completely. Toss the chicken in the sauce, remove the thyme stems, sprinkle with the parsley and serve.

Place the bok choy so that the other cut side faces down. Cook until charred in spots, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, scallion whites, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.

Stir in the scallion greens, then remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the soy sauce and vinegar.__While the bok choy cooks, pat the fish dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.

Easy	25	10	-1	15	4 servings	2 medium Vidalia onions or other sweet onions (about 1 pound)__2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil__Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper__1 tablespoon fish sauce__4 medium radishes, very thinly sliced (use a mandoline if you have one)__1 large bunch watercress, rinsed and dried__1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves__1 pound flank steak	Preheat a very large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until it just begins to smoke.__While the pan is heating, slice the onions into 1/4-inch-thick rings and toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium bowl. Add the onions to the skillet and cook, undisturbed, until they char slightly, about 2 minutes. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon until they are further charred and slightly softened but still crunchy, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.__Stir together the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the fish sauce in the medium bowl that the onions were in. Add the radishes, watercress, cilantro and cooked onions and toss until well coated. Allow the mixture to sit at least 5 minutes, so the juices from the onion combine with the dressing.__Wipe out the skillet the onions cooked in and return it to medium-high heat. Sprinkle the steak with 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and put it into the hot skillet. Cook until well browned on one the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes; flip and cook until medium rare, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a cutting board and allow the steak to rest for a few minutes, then slice thinly against the grain.__Divide the salad mixture among 4 bowls. Top each bowl with slices of steak.

Simply-seasoned pork chops cook alongside corn and onions, which then get tossed with canned black-eyed peas and juicy summer tomatoes-no extra pan. You won't miss the butter and cream traditionally used in succotash; a dollop of cumin-spiced sour cream is even better.	Easy	25	10	-1	15	4 Servings	2 medium yellow tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch thick wedges (about 1 pound)__Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper__1/2 cup sour cream__Zest and juice of 1 lime__1/4 teaspoon cumin__1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates__4 bone-in pork chops, 1-inch thick (about 3 pounds)__4 ears yellow corn, shucked__1 large red onion, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds (about 8 ounces)__One 15-ounce can black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed__1/2 cup roughly-chopped fresh parsley	Prepare a grill or large grill pan for medium-high heat.__Put the tomatoes into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.__Put the sour cream, lime zest and juice, cumin and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Reserve.__Lightly oil the grill grates. Brush the pork all over with 2 tablespoons of the oil and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Arrange the pork on one side of the grill (leave room for grilling the vegetables) and cook until lightly charred on both sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of a chop registers 140 degrees F, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.__Meanwhile, brush the corn and onion liberally with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and arrange them on the grill. Cook the corn until lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes, rotating the ears so that they cook evenly. Cook the onion until charred and tender, 6 to 8 minutes, flipping as needed. Transfer the vegetables to a cutting board and cool for 2 to 3 minutes. When cool enough to handle, cut the corn away from the cobs and quarter the onion rounds. Add the corn, onion, black-eyed peas and half of the parsley to the same large bowl with the tomatoes. Gently toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.__Divide the succotash among 4 large dinner plates and top with a dollop of the reserved sour cream mixture. Place 1 pork chop on each plate next to the succotash. Garnish the succotash with the reserved parsley and serve immediately.

Easy	-1	-1	-1	-1	6 doughnuts	1 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread, such as Nutella__4 large eggs__2 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note), plus more for dusting	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.__Whisk 3/4 cup of the Nutella and 3 of the eggs together in a large bowl until smooth. Fold in the flour until combined. Turn the dough out onto a generously floured surface and press into a 6-by-8-inch rectangle. Use a 3-inch round cutter to stamp out 6 doughnuts, rerolling the scraps as needed. Use a 1-inch round cutter to cut a hole in the center of each round, then place doughnuts and holes onto the prepared baking sheet. Beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush the tops of the doughnuts and holes with the egg wash.__Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a doughnut comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes. Microwave the remaining 1/4 cup Nutella in a small microwave-safe bowl just to loosen it, about 30 seconds. Dip the tops of the doughnuts and holes in the Nutella and swirl to completely coat. Place back, coated-sides up, onto the wire rack and let sit until set, about 15 minutes.

The sausage is filled with spices and aromatics that punch up the flavor of the soup, so you don't have to add any extra seasonings.

If there are lots of browned bits on the bottom that look like they might burn, add 2 tablespoons of broth and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon. Cook the onions, stirring frequently and adding more broth to the bottom of the pot as needed, until completely tender, about 10 minutes. Add the white beans and remaining broth and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook over medium heat until the beans split open, about 10 minutes.__Use an immersion blender to puree the soup in the pot until completely smooth or carefully transfer the hot liquid to a blender to puree. Season the soup with salt. Serve the soup topped with the sausage.

Red raspberries, white chocolate pastry cream and blueberries top an almond shortbread crust. Add a dusting of confectioners' sugar and you have an easy, yet elegant, pastry. I made the tart in a rectangular pan to mimic the shape of the flag, but it also works well in a more traditional round pan or even as individual tartlettes. Later in the summer try this same dessert, but switch the berries for fresh peaches or plums.

Pulse several times to combine. Add the butter and egg yolk, process just until the dough comes together. Distribute the dough into the 13-by-4-inch tart pan (or 10-inch round).__Lay plastic wrap over the dough and press it into the pan so that it is an even thickness. Remove the plastic and freeze the dough until it is firm, about 20 minutes.__Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cover the dough with foil and fill with pie weights or beans. This will keep the dough from slouching in the pan. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and beans, bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes or until the crust is a light golden color. Allow to cool to room temperature.__Prepare the pastry cream: Whisk together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sugar. Add the egg yolks to the cornstarch and mix into a smooth paste. Set aside.__Bring the milk, remaining 1/4 cup of the sugar, vanilla bean, and salt to a gentle simmer in a medium saucepan. Slowly, and in small amounts, whisk the hot milk into the egg mixture. Once the egg mixture is warm to the touch, pour it back into the milk in the pan.__Bring the custard to a gentle boil, whisking continuously for 2 to 3 minutes. The pastry cream will thicken almost immediately, but it is important to cook the starch until it isn't grainy. When the pastry cream is done it will be smooth and glossy.__Remove from the heat and add the butter and white chocolate to the pastry cream. Allow to sit for 3 minutes, then gently whisk them together. Pour the pastry cream into a shallow container. Cover with plastic wrap, pressed directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Set the container in the freezer for 15 minutes (this cools down the eggs quickly) and then refrigerate for up to a few days.__Fill the cooled tart shell with the pastry cream. Decorate the top with the berries and refrigerate until ready to serve. Dust with confectioners' sugar right before slicing and serving.

This Italian-American tradition is something I look forward to every year because it means that all of my family gathers around one table to crack shellfish, drink wine and laugh until Santa comes to town. My Nonna Marianna would spend days preparing for this meal, all the while teaching me to make her shellfish pasta, olive salads with calamari, stuffed squid, fried fish, and baccala folded into creamy risotto. While all of these dishes are incredible, I wanted to create a scaled-down version of this meal that still honors the Seven Fishes tradition. My family loves to spice it up, hence the inclusion of crushed red pepper to make this fra diavolo in style. Feel free to mix up the seafood to your family’s favorites!	Intermediate	-1	-1	-1	-1	4 to 6 servings	3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil__1/2 cup panko__Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper__1 lemon, zested and halved__1/2 bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped (about 1/4 cup)__1 shallot, thinly sliced__5 cloves garlic, minced__1 tablespoon crushed red pepper__2 teaspoons anchovy paste__1 1/4 cups dry white wine__1 dozen littleneck clams, scrubbed clean__1/2 pound mussels (about 8), beards removed__One 28-ounce can tomato puree__1 tablespoon dried oregano__1 pound long pasta (I like fettucine or linguine)__1 pound center-cut halibut, skin removed, cut into 4 equal pieces__6 diver scallops (about 1/2 pound), tough side muscle removed__6 jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined (about 1/2 pound)__1 cup calamari rings (7 ounces)	Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and heat until fragrant. Pour in the panko and shake into an even layer. Sprinkle in the lemon zest and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until toasted and golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Scrape the breadcrumbs into a bowl. Stir in the parsley and set aside for plating. Reserve the skillet.__While the breadcrumbs are cooking, place a large saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the remaining olive oil and heat until fragrant. Add the shallot and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add in the garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook, stirring, just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the anchovy paste and fry, stirring, for 1 minute more. Increase the heat to medium high. Add 1 cup of the white wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add the clams, cover and steam for 2 minutes. Add the mussels, cover again and steam just until the shellfish open, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the cooked shellfish to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon and set aside for plating. Reduce the heat to medium and add the tomato puree to the pan. Use the remaining 1/4 cup white wine to swish around any tomato puree clinging to the can (just like Nonna would). Add it to the sauce, along with the dried oregano. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.__Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions for al dente.__While the pasta cooks, sprinkle salt and black pepper on all sides of the scallops, shrimp and halibut. Place the reserved skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat until shimmering. Add the halibut and scallops, spacing them apart (so they sear, rather than steam). Cook, without disturbing, until deeply golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the scallops and cook the other side for 1 minute. Remove to a plate and set aside. Flip the halibut and cook until seared on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shrimp to the skillet, spacing them around the halibut, and cook until the shrimp are opaque and lightly seared, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the skillet from the heat and squeeze the lemon juice over the shrimp and halibut. Remove to the plate and set aside.__To finish the sauce, add the calamari and simmer for 1 minute over medium heat. Lift the pasta with tongs from the boiling water into the sauce. Toss until evenly coated. Add the cooked shellfish and any liquid that collected in the bowl. Toss to thoroughly combine.__To serve, plate the pasta first. Sprinkle generously with the breadcrumbs. Top with the seared scallops, shrimp and halibut. Serve immediately.

When the stock reaches a boil, add the rice and stir it a bit to prevent sticking. Let it come to a rolling boil and lower the heat a bit to medium. Stir the rice once in a while, you want the rice to absorb all of the liquid; it should take 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the rice; it should be slightly al dente but creamy. Remove the pot from the heat, add the cheeses and stir well. Pour the rice onto a baking sheet and spread into a thin layer. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool, preferably overnight in the fridge.__For the ragu: Mix the ground beef and pork together with your hands and add salt and pepper generously. Set aside.__In a medium saucepot over medium low heat, saute the pancetta with the olive oil until the fat is melted. Add the onions and let cook until soft, about 5 minutes.

Keep mixing with a wooden spoon until the meat is well done and browned. Add the white wine and stir until it is evaporated. Add the tomato puree and tomato paste in water. Bring to a boil, and then lower the heat to medium, stirring occasionally. There will be some fat that comes to the top. Skim it off with a ladle but you want to leave some for the flavor. Let cook for about 1 1/2 hours.__About 5 minutes before the ragu is done, saute the peas in a touch of butter with a pinch of salt and add to the ragu. Put the ragu in a bowl and set aside to cool. You can leave it overnight covered in the fridge.__For the filling and assembly: Portion out cooled rice into identical portions. We weigh ours to 1.6 ounces. Take one portion and form it into a semi-circle in the palm of your hand, making a cup-like shape to place the ragu and mozzarella into. Scoop a generous amount of ragu, about 2 teaspoons, into the half ball and then a few cubes of mozzarella. Take another portion of rice and flatten it into a disk shape. Place that disk over the half ball to enclose the ragu and cheese in the center. Have a bowl of warm water nearby to dip your hands into' it'll make the process easier and less sticky. Roll the ball around to enclose all ingredients in the center and shape into a perfectly round ball. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.__For the batter and breading: Place the flour and 1 1/2 cups cold water into a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Mix with a whisk until smooth and about the consistency of eggnog. Add the breadcrumbs to a large bowl or baking dish. Roll each rice ball in the batter and shake off excess batter. Then roll each ball in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with all the balls.__Use a heavy duty pot with enough canola oil to submerge the balls in. Make sure the oil isn't near the top of the pot because it will overflow when you drop your balls in. Bring the oil to 350 degrees F, using a high temp thermometer if you have one. If not you can throw a small piece of white bread in to test; it should brown quickly and float when the oil is hot enough.__Use a slotted spoon or wire basket to lower your balls into the hot oil. Don't overcrowd the balls - maybe 2 or 3 at a time. Fry in batches until they are golden like arancini ("little oranges"), about 5 minutes. Remove and place on paper towels to drain. Eat hot.

It's frozen salmon to the rescue. Since the texture of seafood changes from freezing, it's important to add moisture back in and cook it right. I've discovered that cutting salmon into bite-size pieces, like those in this stir-fry, enhances the texture of this omega-3-rich fish.	Easy	30	15	-1	15	4 servings	1 large bunch broccoli, florets cut bite-size, long stems sliced (about 4 cups)__Finely grated zest and juice of 1 medium orange (See Cook's Note)__2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce, plus more for serving__1 pound salmon, skinned, patted dry and cut into bite-size pieces__2 cloves garlic, minced__Serving suggestions: rice or noodles	Add 1/2 inch water to a large wok or saute pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli, covering loosely to allow steam to escape, and cook until bright green and nearly fork-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain and transfer the broccoli to a plate. Wipe the remaining broccoli debris out of the pan.__Combine the orange zest, juice and soy sauce in a small bowl. Season the salmon with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Place the pan over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon high-heat cooking oil, like rice bran, canola or grapeseed. Tilt the pan to thoroughly coat the surface where you will be placing the salmon. Carefully add the salmon to the hot oil, reduce the heat to medium, and sprinkle in the garlic. Cook, undisturbed until browned on the bottoms, and the sides of the salmon turn opaque, about 3 minutes. Pour in the orange and soy sauce, and turn the salmon. Add the broccoli and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook until the salmon is cooked through and the juice thickens a bit, about 3 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the salmon and broccoli and serve with rice or noodles and additional soy sauce.
